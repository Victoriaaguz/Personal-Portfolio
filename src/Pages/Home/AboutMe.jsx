            My dream is to one day work for a high-tech company such as Google, Apple, or Microsoft. 
            I am also happy to go into early education teaching young children their fundamentals. 
            I am also the founder of Task Adventure an app to help kids with autism stay on schedule. 
            I want to create educational applications that introduce and engage students of all ages. 
            In my free time, I like to watch theater performances in Hollywood and crochet items to get a break from the screen.</p>

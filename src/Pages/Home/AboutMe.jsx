            I am a student at California State University, Fullerton.
              I am currently studying computer science and will graduate in the spring of 2025 with a Bachelor's in Computer Science.
              I have a Google certificate in IT support and will soon have an Assistant Teaching Certificate. I am passionate about learning new things and adding my own creativity to my projects.

            My dream is to one day work for a high-tech company such as Google, Apple, or Microsoft. I am also happy to go into teaching young children their fundamentals. I want to create something that helps kids learn topics in a new way. I want to create educational applications that introduce and engage students of all ages. In my free time, I like to watch theater performances in Hollywood and Crochet items to get a break from the screen.</p>
